If you have a favorite piece of jargon or want to suggest a correction, let us know in the comments below.

The U.S. military uses many unique items and concepts that civilians  aren't exposed to. Because of this and the need for expedient, clear  communication, service members are immersed in a linguistic world apart  from the daily life of a civilian. Some are self-explanatory and others  are completely cryptic, but they each have a specific and important  (sometimes) meaning.
