<h3>FreeBSD</h3>
<!-- Recommend -->
<p>FreeBSD is a UNIX-like operating system for the i386, amd64, IA-64, arm, MIPS, powerpc, ppc64, PC-98 and UltraSPARC platforms based on U.C. Berkeley&#39;s &quot;4.4BSD-Lite&quot; release, with some &quot;4.4BSD-Lite2&quot; enhancements. It is also based indirectly on William Jolitz&#39;s port of U.C. Berkeley&#39;s &quot;Net/2&quot; to the i386, known as &quot;386BSD&quot;, though very little of the 386BSD code remains. FreeBSD is used by companies, Internet Service Providers, researchers, computer professionals, students and home users all over the world in their work, education and recreation. FreeBSD comes with over 20,000 packages (pre-compiled software that is bundled for easy installation), covering a wide range of areas: from server software, databases and web servers, to desktop software, games, web browsers and business software - all free and easy to install.</p>

<h2>Linux</h2>
<h3>Debian</h3>
<p>The Debian Project is an association of individuals who have made common cause to create a free operating system. This operating system is called Debian. </p>
<p>Debian systems currently use the Linux kernel. Linux is a completely free piece of software started by Linus Torvalds and supported by thousands of programmers worldwide. </p>
<p>Of course, the thing that people want is application software: programs to help them get what they want to do done, from editing documents to running a business to playing games to writing more software. Debian comes with over 50,000 packages (precompiled software that is bundled up in a nice format for easy installation on your machine) - all of it free. </p>
<p>It&#39;s a bit like a tower. At the base is the kernel. On top of that are all the basic tools. Next is all the software that you run on the computer. At the top of the tower is Debian -- carefully organizing and fitting everything so it all works together.</p>

<h4>Ubuntu</h4>
<!-- Recommend -->
<p>Ubuntu is a complete desktop Linux operating system, freely available with both community and professional support. The Ubuntu community is built on the ideas enshrined in the Ubuntu Manifesto: that software should be available free of charge, that software tools should be usable by people in their local language and despite any disabilities, and that people should have the freedom to customise and alter their software in whatever way they see fit. &quot;Ubuntu&quot; is an ancient African word, meaning &quot;humanity to others&quot;. The Ubuntu distribution brings the spirit of Ubuntu to the software world.</p>
