# Tool Guides

Below are step-by-step tutorials to help you install and use handy privacy and security tools. Surveillance Self-Defense encourages you to think about online privacy and security in a sophisticated way. We want to give you the power to choose tools and habits that work for you. We suggest conducting a [threat modeling assessment](https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/assessing-your-risks) before moving on to the following install guides. Please note that the law and technology can change quickly, and portions of SSD can become out of date. Check EFFâ€™s Security Education blog for the latest news.
